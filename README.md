## 🌌 The Vision

Luciiid is not a meme — it is **a movement of belief**.  
A living, transparent ecosystem where **art, code, and consciousness unite**.  
Built on **Solana**, $LUCIIID transforms faith into a measurable force of creation — where every holder becomes a believer, every believer becomes a creator, and every creation feeds back into the light.

> “We are the architects of our own awakening.  
> What we believe, we manifest.”

- Trade and collect using $LUCIIID  
- Fund new Temples through Treasury royalties
